# Personal Portfolio Webpage

The webpage I submitted to freeCodeCamp for "Personal Portfolio Webpage".

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to <https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks/>

For full information regarding the project, visit <https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage-project/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage>

I did some changes with the "user-stories" section, and ended up with <https://scorpius07.github.io/Personal-Portfolio-Webpage/>

For any suggestions or comments, contact me on my Discord (Scorpius07#7945). Thank you!
